	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. It helps us determine how efficient an algorithm is.</p>

	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm uses relative to the input size. For example, an algorithm that requires O(n) space uses memory that grows linearly with the input size.</p>
